# Machine Learning With Application 🐟🐠🐡🦐

This is my final project for the 'Machine Learning with Application' course, which was held at Milan University by Professor Carlo Barbieri for the Physics Master degree, in the accademic year 2020-2021.

This project aims to use different algorithms in order to classify a large dataset of fishes into 9 different species. 

The final jupyter notebook that implements and describes all the different algorithms is `fish_classifier.ipynb`
